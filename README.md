# Espanso-System-Wide-Autocorrect 

I will no longer be posting versions to the releases section during pre-release phase as changes are too frequent and there is no reason why anyone should want to use an older version so please just use the version from main. 

Please feel free to submit additional dictionary entries under "Pull requests". 

Installation Instructions: 

A -->  For new users of Espanso: 
1. Navigate to your base.yml file (on windows it will be in {C:\Users\$user\AppData\Roaming\espanso} by default) 
2. Delete it and replace it with the latest release of Autocorrect from the "Releases" page. 
3. You may need to change the file extension to .yml if your operating system messes with it upon download. 


B -->  For existing users of Espanso: 
1. Open the file in whichever text editor you prefer so long as it supports copying raw text. (I use notepad++) 
2. Select and Copy all of the text Starting at "# Beginning of Personal Dictionary" 
5. Open your base.yml file and paste it below the default Espanso contents. 
6. Hit save and wait for the Espanso reload confirmation.
